This here started out as an annoyance project due to some perceived faults in openswoole.
I didnt like its hot reload system, it never seemed to work.

As with everything else, you better understand why certain decisions are made when you have to make them yourself, so i wanted to write this so i better understand why openswoole works the way it works.
